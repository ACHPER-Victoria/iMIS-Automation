# iMIS - Automation
Various things to make iMIS life easier

## DailyMemberToNonMember
This task converts specific users returned in an IQA query to non-member status. (Useful for purging certain types of "temporary" or "pending" kind of members.)

## Generate Renewals
TBC - This would be nice. Probably not going to happen anytime soon though.

## Auto subscribe on purchase
TBC - Need to implement this.
